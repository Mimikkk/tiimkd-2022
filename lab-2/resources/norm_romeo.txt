dream things true o then i see queen mab hath been with you she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies athwart men s noses as they lie asleep her wagon spokes made of long spinners legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers her traces of the smallest spider s web her collars of the moonshine s wat ry beams her whip of cricket s bone the lash of film her wagoner a small grey coated gnat not half so big as a round little worm prick d from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazelnut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o mind the fairies coachmakers and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love o er courtiers knees that dream on cursies straight o er lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees o er ladies lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops o er a courtier s nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithe pig s tail tickling a parson s nose as a lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice sometimes she driveth o er a soldier s neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades of healths five fadom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is she peace peace mercutio peace thou talk st of nothing true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and being anger d puffs away from thence turning his face to the dew dropping south this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves supper is done and we shall come too late i fear too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night

instruments upon them fit to open these dead men s tombs o heavens o wife look how our daughter bleeds this dagger hath mista en for lo his house is empty on the back of montague and it missheathed in my daughter s bosom o me this sight of death is as a bell that warns my old age to a sepulchre enter montague and others come montague for thou art early up to see thy son and heir more early down alas my liege my wife is dead to night grief of my son s exile hath stopp d her breath what further woe conspires against mine age look and thou shalt see o thou untaught what manners is in this to press before thy father to a grave seal up the mouth of outrage for a while till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring their head their true descent and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death meantime forbear and let mischance be slave to patience bring forth the parties of suspicion i am the greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murther and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excus d then say it once what thou dost know in this i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeo s faithful wife i married them and their stol n marriage day was tybalt s doomsday whose untimely death banish d the new made bridegroom from this city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pin d you to remove that siege of grief from her betroth d and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutored by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave being the time the potion s force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stay d by accident and yesternight return d my letter back then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred s vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrific d some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest law we still have known thee for a holy man where s romeo s man what can he say in this i brought my master news of juliet s death and then in post he came from mantua to this same place to this same monument this letter he early bid me give his father and threat ned me with death going in the vault if i departed not and left him there give me the letter i will look on it where is the county s page that rais d the watch sirrah what made your master in this place he came with flowers to strew his lady s grave and bid me stand aloof and so i did anon comes one with light to ope the tomb and by and by my master drew on him and then i ran away to call the watch this letter doth make good the friar s words their course of love the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet where be these enemies capulet montage see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love and i for winking at you discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punish d o brother montague give me thy hand this is my daughter s jointure for no more can i demand but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold that whiles verona by that name is known there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet as rich shall romeo s by his lady s lie poor sacrifices of our enmity a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head go hence to have more talk of these sad things some shall be pardon d and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo exeunt omnes the end
